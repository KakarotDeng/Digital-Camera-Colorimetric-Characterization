# Digital-Camera-Colorimetric-Characterization
A simple characterization model based on polynomial regression

Input : Raw image
        Optical power spectrum collected by spectral radiometer
        Spectral reflectance of color and white cards collected by spectrophotometer

Target : Calculate the Eab between the predicted tri-stimulus value based on polynomial regression model and the actual tri-stimulus value
